# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Model

This project contains a Python script (`model.py`) designed to predict Alzheimer's disease using various machine learning models. The script processes the dataset, applies preprocessing steps, and evaluates different classifiers based on their performance.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this script, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. This project uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

To run this script, you first need to install the required Python libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Dataset

Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and accessible to the script. The dataset should be named alzheimers_disease_data.csv and placed in the same directory as model.py. Alternatively, you can modify the script to point to the correct path where your dataset is located.
Running the Script

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing model.py and execute the following command in your terminal:

python model.py

Features of the Script

The script performs the following operations:

    Data Loading: Loads data from a CSV file.

    Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for modeling, including scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables.

    Data Visualization: Generates histograms, boxplots, and a correlation matrix to explore data distributions and relationships.

    Model Training: Trains multiple machine learning models using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters.

    Evaluation: Evaluates the models based on their classification performance and prints the results.

Customizing the Script

You can customize the script by modifying the custom_labels dictionary to reflect the actual categories of your categorical variables in the dataset.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly, and the dataset is formatted as expected. Check the console output for any error messages that might give more insight into what might be going wrong.

### Additional Notes
- **Include Details**: If your script or setup requires more specific instructions (like environment variables, specific Python versions, etc.), make sure to include those.
- **Contact Information**: If itâ€™s a collaborative project or if you wish to provide a point of contact for issues, include that information at the end of your README.
- **License**: If you want to include a license for your code, you should state this in the README.

This template should give you a solid foundation to start from, and you can expand it based on the specifics or additional features of your project.
